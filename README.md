# python-api-challenge

The purpose of this project is use Python along with APIs and JSON traversals to  more definitively answer the question, "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?" We all know the answer to this, although until now, we did not have the data points and analysis to prove it out.

In addition to answering the question above, once that data has been analyzed, the subsequent task is to create a short sample of locations to travel to based on several conditions.  These conditions involve setting parameters based on personal preference to lists of data.

Factors involved in the analysis include the following (below list is not exhaustive):

    - Data analysis performed using only two factors at a time, which limits the potential of more thorough conclusions.
    - Data used is limited to a singular point-in-time, not allowing for more thorough analysis of average values over a reasonable time period.
